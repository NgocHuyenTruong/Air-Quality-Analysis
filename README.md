# **Air Quality Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on the statistical analysis of air quality data collected from a device located at road level in a highly polluted area of an Italian city. Understanding the factors contributing to air pollution is essential for developing effective policies and interventions to improve air quality.

## **Introduction**
Air pollution is a global problem affecting the health and well-being of millions. In this report, we analyze a dataset containing information on various air pollutants and weather variables, such as temperature and humidity. We perform exploratory data analysis and multiple regression analysis to identify the key variables influencing air quality.

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes:
- Air quality measurements of different pollutants
- Weather variables such as temperature and humidity
- Dataset source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Air Quality Dataset] https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Python**: For data analysis and statistical modeling
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **StatsModels/Scikit-learn**: For regression analysis

## **Objectives**
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset
- Perform multiple regression analysis to identify key factors influencing air quality
- Utilize data visualization to present findings clearly
- Provide insights to inform policy decisions and interventions
